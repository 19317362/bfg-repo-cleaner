<h1>an alternative to git-filter-branch</h1>
<p>The BFG is a simpler, faster alternative to <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch"><code>git-filter-branch</code></a> for cleansing bad data out of your Git repository history:</p>

<ul>
<li>Removing <strong>Crazy Big Files</strong></li>
<li>Removing <strong>Passwords</strong>, <strong>Credentials</strong> &amp; other <strong>Private data</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>git-filter-branch</code> command is enormously powerful and can do things that the BFG can't - but the BFG is <em>much</em> better for the tasks above, because:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#speed">Faster</a> : <strong>10 - 50x</strong> faster</li>
<li><a href="#examples">Simpler</a> : The BFG isn't particularily clever, but <em>is</em> focused on making the above tasks easy</li>
<li>Beautiful : If you need to, you can use the beautiful Scala language to customise the BFG. Which has got to be better than Bash scripting at least some of the time.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>First clone a copy of your repo:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone --bare git://example.com/some-big-repo.git
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can run the BFG to clean your repository up:</p>
<pre><code>$ java -jar <a class="latest-download-link" href="#download">bfg.jar</a> --strip-biggest-blobs 500 some-big-repo.git
</code></pre>
<p>The BFG will update your commits and all branches and tags so they are clean, but it doesn't physically delete the unwanted stuff. Examine the repo to make sure your history has been updated, and then use the standard <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-gc"><code>git gc</code></a> command to strip out the unwanted dirty data, which Git will now recognise as surplus to requirements:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd some-big-repo.git
$ git gc --prune=now --aggressive
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, once you're happy with the updated state of your repo, push it back up:</p>
<pre><code>$ git push --mirror</code></pre>
<p>At this point, you're ready for everyone to ditch their old copies of the repo and do fresh clones of the nice, new pristine data.</p>

<h1 id="examples">Examples</h1>
<p>In all these examples <code>bfg</code> is an alias for <code>java -jar bfg.jar</code>.</p>

<p>Delete all files named 'id_rsa' or 'id_dsa' :</p>
<pre><code>$ bfg <strong>--delete-files id_{dsa,rsa}</strong>  my-repo.git</code></pre>

<p>Remove all blobs bigger than 1 megabyte :</p>
<pre><code>$ bfg <strong>--strip-blobs-bigger-than 1M</strong>  my-repo.git</code></pre>

<p>Replace all passwords (listed in a file 'passwords.txt') with <code>***REMOVED***</code> :</p>
<pre><code>$ bfg <strong>--replace-banned-strings passwords.txt</strong>  my-repo.git</code></pre>

<h1 id="protected-commits">Your <em>current</em> files are sacred...</h1>

<p>
The BFG treats you like a reformed alcoholic: you've made some mistakes in the past, but now you've cleaned up your act. Thus the BFG assumes that
your latest commit is a <em>good</em> one, with none of the dirty files you want removing from your history still in it. This assumption by the BFG
protects your work, and gives you peace of mind knowing that the BFG is <em>only</em> changing your repo history, not meddling with the
<em>current</em> files of your project.
</p>

<p>By default the <code>HEAD</code> branch is protected, and while it's history will be cleaned, the very latest commit
(the 'tip') is a <strong>protected commit</strong> and it's file-hierarchy won't be changed at all.</p>

<p>If you want to protect the tips of several branches or tags (not just HEAD), just name them for the BFG:</p>

<pre><code>$ bfg --strip-biggest-blobs 100<strong> --protect-blobs-from master,maint,next</strong> repo.git</code></pre>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>

<li>The BFG is about <em>completely</em> removing bad stuff from the history of your repo. If something questionable - like a 10MB file, when you're telling The BFG to strip out everying over 5MB - is in a protected commit, it <em>won't</em> be removed, and because it's still there, there's no point deleting it from earlier commits either. If you want the BFG to delete something <strong>you need to make sure your current commits are 
<em>clean</em></strong>.

<li>Note that although the files in those protected commits won't be changed, when those commits follow on from earlier dirty commits, their commit 
ids <strong>will</strong> change, to reflect the changed history - only the SHA-1 id of the filesystem-tree will remain the same.
</ul>

<h1 id="speed">Faster...</h1>
<p>The BFG is 10 - 50x faster than <code>git-filter-branch</code>, turning an <em>overnight</em> job into one that takes <em>less than ten minutes</em>. BFG's performance advantage is due to these factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>The approach of <code>git-filter-branch</code> is to step through every commit in your repository, examining the complete file-hierarchy of each one. For the intended use-cases of The BFG this is wasteful, as we don't care <em>where</em> in a file structure a 'bad' file exists - we just want it dealt with. Inherent in the nature of Git is that <em>every</em> file and folder is represented precisely once (and given a unique <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> hash-id). The BFG takes advantage of this to process each and every file &amp; folder exactly <strong>once</strong> - no need for extra work.</li>
<li>Taking advantage of the great support for parallelism in <a href="http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html">Scala</a> and the JVM, the BFG does multi-core processing by default - the work of cleaning your Git repository is spread over every single core in your machine and typically consumes 100% of capacity for a substantial portion of the run.</li>
<li>All action takes place in a single process (the process of the JVM), so doesn't require the frequent fork-and-exec-ing needed by <code>git-filter-branch</code>'s mix of Bash and C code.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">Java Runtime Environment</a> (JRE 6.0 or above)</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it - the Scala library and all other dependencies are folded into the <a class="latest-download-link" href="#download">downloadable jar</a>.</p>
